## List of added icons

- corectrl

- youtube-music (th-ch)
- curseforge
- mpd
- smplayer
- system-config-samba
- smb4k (sym)

## Test

Icons in Test folder were made from PNG with Bitmap Tracing. They are usable but the quality is not great at all. Use them if you want but i suggest ignoring it.  

### Todo

- [ ] Try split version of Nvim
- [ ] Add remaining icons
